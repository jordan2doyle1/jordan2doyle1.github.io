This repository contains my professional resume in the form of a modern and simple webpage. The live version of the webpage can be seen [here](https://jordan2doyle1.github.io).

### Template and Theme

This repository uses a modified version of the *[modern-resume-theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme/)*, a resume template and theme powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages. How to use this template is detailed in the repository documentation.
